# The Contract Is the MFE

## A framework-free module between producer and consumer

> **Problem.** Cross-team MFE integration drifts on types: the shell
> guesses prop names, event payloads get `any`, and "the API is whatever
> the component happens to accept" — discoverable only by reading the
> producer's source, which you shouldn't have to import.

> **Fix.** Publish a framework-neutral contract module. It carries the
> app key, `z` schemas for props and events, and a worker factory —
> nothing else. The shell imports *that*; its own framework's facade
> derives the typed component surface at compile time.

Once an MFE lives in a worker, the question "what does the shell
import?" gets an interesting answer: *not the component*. The component
— plus its entire framework — is inside the worker bundle, which the
browser fetches as an asset. What the shell imports is a contract:

```ts
// counter.contract.ts — the package's ONLY export.
// No framework imports: this file runs on both threads.
import { z } from '@atolljs/core';
import { defineIslandContract } from '@atolljs/islands';

export const counterContract = defineIslandContract({
  app: 'counter',
  props: z.object({ label: z.string().optional() }),
  events: {
    incremented: z.object({ count: z.number(), label: z.string() }),
  },
  worker: () => new Worker(bundledWorkerUrl, { type: 'module' }),
});
```

That's the whole public API — four fields:

| Field | What it pins down |
|-------|-------------------|
| `app` | the registry key the worker registers under — shell and worker must agree |
| `props` | a `z` schema; the *worker* validates props on mount and every `updateProps` |
| `events` | named `z` schemas; `emit('incremented', payload)` validates against the declared schema inside the worker |
| `worker` | a factory returning the `Worker` — local source entry in dev, prebuilt asset or remote origin when published |

Two properties are worth noticing. First, the schemas aren't just for
type derivation — they're enforced at runtime, *inside* the worker, on
the trust boundary where a shell from another team actually needs
validation. A producer that ships a prop rename breaks with a schema
error naming the field, not a silent `undefined`.

Second, `worker` is a *factory*, so the deployment shape is a consumer
decision. Same contract can point at a bundled dev entry, a
package-relative prebuilt artifact, or a CDN origin — the producer
doesn't have to know which.

## The shell's side

Each supported framework has a facade that turns the contract into an
idiomatic component — `islandComponent` for React:

```tsx
import { islandComponent } from '@atolljs/react-island';
import counterContract from '@atolljs/mfe-counter';

const CounterIsland = islandComponent(counterContract);

<CounterIsland
  label="alpha"                                  // typed from props schema
  onEvent={(name, payload) => {                 // name: 'incremented'
    // payload: { count: number; label: string } // typed per event
  }}
/>
```

`label` is optional-string because the schema says so; `payload`'s
shape narrows per event name because the events map says so. All of it
flows from the contract module — the shell never imports worker source
and doesn't need the worker's framework installed. A Vue shell gets
`defineIslandComponent(contract)` with the same inference; Angular
types the contract through an injectable.

And the worker side attaches the *same* contract object, so the two
ends can't drift on the `app` key or drift on schemas:

```ts
// counter.worker.tsx — inside the worker bundle
export default defineReactMonoWorker(CounterApp, {
  contract: counterContract,   // mount, updateProps, emit all validated
});
```

One module, imported by both sides, checked by the compiler on the
shell side and enforced by the runtime on the worker side. That's the
whole seam — and it's the artifact you version.
