# LinkedIn — AtollJS Devtools

so the emojis and line breaks are the formatting.

**Once real work moves into a worker pool, your app becomes a black box — console.log across eight threads is a scramble, and the question that matters (*which worker is slow, and doing what?*) has no answer.**

So I built devtools for **AtollJS** — one line to turn on, zero cost when off:

```ts
import { initDevtools } from '@atolljs/devtools';
initDevtools({ session: { name: 'my-app' } });
// my-app/?__atoll_devtools → on. Without the param → no-op.
```

What you get:

🗺️ **The app map** — a live canvas drawn like the atoll it's named for: session at the center, pools on the rim, workers mid-orbit, islands on the outer orbit as framework marks. Zoom, drill, inspect.

🌊 **A task waterfall** — one swimlane per worker slot, queued→dispatched→settled, with per-task p95s and failure counts.

📡 **Real network + memory** — `fetch()` logging from main thread *and* workers, per-field shared-memory write rates, per-worker heaps.

🔍 **Post-mortem sessions** — a disconnected page is retained as an ended session, so history stays attributed after the crash.

The design choices that make it cheap:

⚡ **A sink, not a wire** — `emitDevtools` is one branch on a module sink; nothing transports until something installs one. "Off" costs nothing.

🧵 **One transport per app, never per worker** — a `poolSize: 32` pool still costs one connection; workers forward events over the task channel the pool already owns.

🔒 **The transport is the scoping** — BroadcastChannel in the browser means same-origin isolation by spec. No filter, a guarantee.

🖥️ **Node too** — `ATOLL_DEVTOOLS=1` + `npx atoll-devtools` and your Express/Nest pools show up on the same dashboard.

## Teaser variant (short post)

Worker pools make your app a black box — AtollJS devtools make it a map.
One gated line of code, zero cost when off: app map, task waterfall,
fetch log, per-field shared-memory writes, per-worker heaps — browser
and Node on one dashboard.
